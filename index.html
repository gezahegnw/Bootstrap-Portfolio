               Hello World, my name is gezahegn worku I am 35 years Old, originally I am from Ethiopia western part of Africa. Currently I live in one of the greatest country on the planet Olathe United States of America, I am marred to wonderful, and most beautifully women in the World and she gave me two beautiful kids. My little angle is 8 years old and my handsome son is 4 years old. My family is my world and everything, I am nothing without them. 
             </p>
             <P class="col-4">
                 About 12 years ago I started my journey to the United States of America, land of opportunity. Even though, leaving my country, my family my friend was the hardest thing I ever experienced. I had no other chose. It was the golden opportunity that happens only one time in life. So somehow, I had to leave everything behand and chase my life dream to U.S.A. After traveling two days, finally, I arrived to California.
            </P>
             <p class="col-4"> 
                 After a week my dad took me to adult education center and enrolled me in English as a second language lesson. Next day I took a placement test and scored level two. The following Monday I started a class. My teacher introduced me to class and asked me to introduce myself to the class. I was very scared, I did not know what to say or how to say it. Somehow I managed it to say few words. I was very surprised because no one laughed at me. Then I said, Hua, I think I did well on that. Since that day I never missed a class, even one day.
             </p>

                    <p class="col-lg">
                      Then after a little while, it was time to find a job and make some money. I remember when I was looking for my first job in here the United States, someone else had to help me to fill up an employment application. Because I did not  understand anything the application saying or asking for. I was very embarrassed because that I felt like I was stupid or something.  But I started pushing myself harder and harder. I started going to the library and borrowed books and DVDs. I took them home read and watched over and over.  Before I knew it, I became very good at listening and speaking un-English.  From knowing any English words to almost becoming perfect listener and speaker. I realized that I can overcome any fears and obstacles and achieve anything if I work hard and push myself to over my limit.               
                    </p>

                </div>
              <div class="col">
                <p>
                  I pushed myself hard for last 12 years to overcome my weakness. So pushing myself over my limit is not new for me I got used to this and I would push myself same way like I been doing before. if have to push myself even more harder, I would do that without any problem in order to be great at coding boot camp and get most out of it then become greatest web developer of all time.
